README: vim-asciidoc-folding
============================

== Introduction

This plugin provides a fold expression for vim to enable folding asciidoc files
(like this one.)

== Installation

After installing the files, you may need to set the `foldmethod` to `foldexpr`.
You may want to consider doing this with an autocommand or ftplugin file, so
it's automatically done whenever you load an asciidoc file.

=== Pathogen et al.

Just drop the files from the git repository in `~/.vim/bundle/`, as you would
with any other pathogen plugin. Be it just unzipping the files, doing a git
clone, or a git submodule.

=== Manually

Drop `folding.vim` into `~/.vim/after/ftplugin/asciidoc/`

== Dependencies

This plugin has some dependencies on the asciidoc syntax highlighting. In
particular, for ignoring any ='s in listing blocks. There isn't a bundled
asciidoc syntax file nor an official one, as far as I'm aware. So you might
have to tweak this plugin to work with other syntax highlighters. You can
always also send me an email or issue if you find one that doesn't work, so
that I can add support.

== Limitations

This plugin has the limitation that it only supports Atx style sections, not
Setext style sections.
