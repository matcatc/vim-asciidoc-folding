INTRODUCTION				       *asciidoc-folding-introduction*

This plugin, originally based on Drew Niel's vim-markdown-folding, enables you
to fold asciidoc documents by section headings. It recognizes only the
Atx-style of headings, as shown below (and described at
http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices/).

    == section level 1

    === section level 2

    ==== section level 3

    ===== section level 4

The alternative Setext style is not currently supported.

Two different folding styles are supported: stacked (the default) and nested.

						    *asciidoc-folding-stacked*
The stacked folding style creates a flat list of sections. When all folds are
closed, the outline resembles a fully expanded table of contents. That is, h1,
h2, h3 etc. headings are all represented equally.

Implementation details: all sections (h1, h2, h3 etc.) initiate a fold with
foldlevel=1.

						     *asciidoc-folding-nested*
The nested folding style creates a heirarchical list of sections. When all
folds are closed (by pressing |zM| or running :set foldlevel=0), the outline
resembles a table of contents (ToC) that only shows h1 sections.

Opening the h1 folds (by running :set foldlevel=1) reveals the content of that
section, with any h2 sections outlined as a ToC.

Opening an h2 fold (by running :set foldlevel=2) reveals the content of that
section, with any h3 sections outlined as a ToC. And so on...

Implementation details: h1 sections initiate a fold with foldlevel=1, h2
sections initiate a fold with foldlevel=2, and so on.

============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				      *asciidoc-folding-configuration*

The stacked folding style is the default.
						       *g:asciidoc_fold_style*
To make the nested folding style the default, put this in your |vimrc|
file:>
    let g:asciidoc_fold_style = 'nested'
<

						*asciidoc-folding-:FoldToggle*
You can switch between the stacked and nested folding styles by running
the command:>
    :FoldToggle
<

The fold style is scoped to each window, which means it's possible to use the
stacked folding style in one split window, and the nested folding style in
another.

                                           *g:asciidoc_fold_override_foldtext*
If set to 0, the fold text will not be overriden:>
    let g:asciidoc_fold_override_foldtext = 0
<
